I used vite as a local development server to implement the slot machine game. 

To open it: 

First, delete node module: rm -rf node module/

Then, install it : npm install

Go to Terminal then Enter : npx vite. 

It will give a local link and open the website.

It might show the localhost page is not found issues. Thus, I think you have to build your own local host server, and run it. 

Enjoy the play!
